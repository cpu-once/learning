- I'm Switching to Meramid.js for Architecture & AI Collaboration
	- Why mermaid?
		- Version Control
			- Diagrams live in Git.
			- Now, We can see diffs of how our logic changed over time.
		- AI Synergy : LLMs (like Gemini) speak mermaid fluently. It's the bridge between our "vibe" and actual implementation.
		- Low Friction: No dRagging boxes or aligning arrows. Focus on the logic, not the pixels.
		- A key benefit of Markdown is that Mermaid.js is written in Markdown syntax; therefore, it ensures high compatibility across various platforms.
		-  Since "Vibe Coding" does not produce consistent output, this Mermaid-oriented approach can assist in our code selection process.

- C Part : For JavaDev - intensive with Design Patterns ( a.k.a GoF)
- Study with Official Docs https://mermaid.js.org/intro/

# A part : Syntax
- All Diagrams definitions begin with a declaration of diagram type, followed by the definitions of the diagram and its contents.
